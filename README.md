# sonosthesia-unity-demo-instrument

This demo showcases the instrument building and MIDI/MPE control capabilities of the sonosthesia framework. In particular the following packages:

- [com.sonosthesia.touch](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.touch)
- [com.sonosthesia.instrument](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.instrument)
- [com.sonosthesia.midi](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-packages/tree/main/packages/com.sonosthesia.midi)

Note the raw MIDI functionality is presented in a separate [demo project](https://github.com/jbat100/sonosthesia-unity-demo-midi).

## Procedural Instrument Builders

Note these builders can be used both in play mode or in edit mode.

### Keyboard

A highly configurable keyboard builder. 

### Experimental

Scaled instrument builders are in development allowing configurable scale and more control over the procedural placement of elements allowing the procedural creation of instruments such as harps and xylophones.
